## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I believe that humans grow (mentally) from birth up until we die. Of course, when person is old, growth slows down significantly, but it is still there (e.g. learning something on news, in a newspaper, reading a book, etc.). But during our lifetime, some people embrace Growth Mindset and try to learn consistently, while others are settling on what they have and lean towards Fixed Mindset, though it doesn't mean that they do not learn anything at all, it's just it is at a slower pace than people with Growth Mindset. But in my opinion, learning never stops!

Struggling is a part of life. In video, Carmen Popoviciu is talking about it, and we can even see that she is struggling with language and expressing some of her thoughts, and that's ok! Same in coding, every single programmer struggled (most still do) with coding, and that is the part of a process. What important is how you approach it (more on it in question 2).

Don't compare to others. Work with others! And if you don't know something, you can learn about it; it will benefit both, you and your co-workers.

P.S. I believe they were talking about Igor Minar at Angular.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

In continuation with my thought about struggling in coding (or anything in life for that matter), the way to approach it is not to panic but to organize your thoughts, identify what you want to accomplish, and research and read on it and how to get there. Ask for help if necessary! Previous section had some good articles about asking for help.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I would think that calendars like Google Calendar would use arrays. For every month in a year, for every day in the month, and even for every hour/minutes (15 mins intervals) during a day that we change and/or modify we'd use an arrays.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array method is the ability to change or modify an existing array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops are used to run the code as long as condition remains true. Once condition is false, code stops running. We use loop without array when we want to see general statement (output) about something, while we use loop with array when we want to use specific names or numbers or get some specific information on each or some of the names or numbers inside an array.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are like a box of chocolates... You start eating first candy knowing that there are 20 candies inside that specific box, and you can only eat 1 at the time (for now). So you'd have to repeat (loop through) the process 20 times.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

There aren't many examples on how to use loops with calculation methods, or rather close to none. Wish that there would be more info about it. (Or was it on purpose?)
