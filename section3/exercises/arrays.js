In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated

Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.

console.log(animals.length)

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals[2] = "Gorilla"
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

var count = animals.push("Dog");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
// Is it a trick exercise? B/c it won't be possible atm, but we can change `Gorilla` string back to `Elephant`.

animals[2] = "Elephant"
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

var foods = ["Bread", "Cheese", "Ham", "Milk"];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

var count = foods.unshift("Broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed

var count = foods.pop("Milk");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

var count = foods.push("Butter", "Honey", "Eggs");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

var count = foods.shift([0]);
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Facebook (probably the most obvious one)
// 2: Twitter (very popular as well)
// 3: Imgur (image sharing and hosting service, but I think we can post GIFs too)
// Extra: Can USB flash drive be considered as one? It has microchip inside, so it is programmed to store, right?


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

// use `if` statement along with comparison and logical operators to check if statement works
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
  // if statement works, log the result using `String`
  console.log("User can call an Uber!");
// use `else` statement if an `if` statement wouldn't work
} else {
  // if this statement works, log the result using `String`
  console.log("User cannot call an Uber...");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
