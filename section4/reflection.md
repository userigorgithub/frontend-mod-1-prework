## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

Personally, I am used to work for at least 45 minutes to an hour, then take a 10-15 minutes break. Sometimes I get too focused and work can go up to 2 hours, but then I have to match it and take a little longer break.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I actually was setting up task(s) that needed to be completed about a day or 2 ahead for a long time now. Sometimes, I have some tasks that need to be completed within a week on certain days as well. I noticed that every now and then I have a slow start, so I have to leave a few days extra time at the end if that happens (so I'd meet a deadline). Also, I always try to leave an extra time in the evening if need be, or do extra work for next day so it would be easier if I am done earlier.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Object is a data type which stores more complex data. Object is quite different from array.
* Object can store many different data while in array we store ordered list of data
* Object can use `string` to access data while in array we use index
* Syntax is different; object can even contain an array

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: Array, because it's just students
  * List of states and their capitals: Object, because there is multiple different data
  * List of things to pack for vacation: Array, because it's just a list of things
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: Array, because it's just one thing -- accounts
  * List of student names and their cohort: Object, because there is multiple different data
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: Object, because (once again) multiple different data
  * All my favorite restaurants: Array, because it's just a list of restaurants

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Amazon!!! Trying to pick correct general section (electronics), then picking correct specific section (computer parts), then we can go even deeper and picking correct part (GPU). Then we have to choose what kind of GPU we want to buy (company: NVidia), model (RTX 3080...), maker (EVGA?), price options.

We also use Objects on Amazon during transactions when we pay for it.

2. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Can key-value pair be like cascading down? Kind of like parent-child with folders (directories) and files, where a parent can also be a child of some previous folder.

Also, is it me or lesson did not cover adding values inside Classes? Or we have to go back to Arrays to do that?
