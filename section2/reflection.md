## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel positive about asking questions. Even though I prefer to solve things myself and sometimes wait a little too long, but I try to find the right balance somewhere in between.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I didn't even notice that directions for command line where absent. For better or worse, I just automatically assumed that I have to go to Section 2 and run files there to continue, but it felt good, to know where to go and what to do beforehand. I believe that if you become really good at something, it becomes as a second nature to you. But you also need to be aware of the surroundings and not just be on autopilot 24/7.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statement is type of statement which determines if something is `true` or `false`. Lets say that I have to start work at 11:30am. So I'll ask myself, "Is it 11:00am and I have to dress up and go to work?" If answer is yes, then I'll start getting ready. If answer is no, then I have some time doing something else. Any web application that is using username and password to log in will have conditional statement.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

We add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if` statement(s). And the final statement must end with `else` statement. We need them if we have multiple statements, and the program first executes `if` statement and if that statement is false, it proceeds to `else if`, and if that is false, it proceeds to `else`.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

We use logical operators `&&` to check if two conditions are met. On the other hand, we use logical operators `||` to check if 1 of 2 conditions are met.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I am interested in seeing `if` statement within `if` statement and within `if` statement. How deep can it go? As long as we can keep track of things and as long as there is enough space?
