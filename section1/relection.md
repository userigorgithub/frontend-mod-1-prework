## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Article resonated well with me. A few things that I already do are taking care of my body (brain), meaning eating healthy, hydration, sleeping enough, studying properly (taking breaks), as well as teaching others. I like to read and learn new things as well. I would add that learning something new every day will keep your brain sharp and staying informative on things around the world will keep you on your toes.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

**Four data types:**
* Strings: Text that is in quotation marks (it can be alphabet, numbers, special characters).
* Numbers (integers and floats): Whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero as an integer, or numbers with decimal points, either positive or negative.
* Booleans: A value that is either true or false.
* Arrays: It represents a group of things which must be in brackets.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

`//` in front of the comment or `/*` (and have `*/` at the end) are used to indicate comments. Comments are used to
make code clearer (explain what you did) to self and others.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

Variable is a value (or a box to 5 year old) which can hold or contain a piece of information (if you put something in a box, that will be an item).

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Site of my bank. My name, amount of cash, and log in conditions are used. So String, Number, and Boolean data types are used.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is basically putting things together in programming.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

The site where things repeat often, concatenation can be used. I don't use it often but when we book a flight, and have final written confirmation, it might have concatenation where it states: "Your flight number is x from x to y at x time."

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I wonder what is used more often, concatenation or interpolation. It seems like interpolation is easier to use.
